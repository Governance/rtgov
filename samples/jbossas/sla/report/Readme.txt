Service Level Agreement - Report
================================

This quickstart provides an example of a deployable report definition, configured to provide a Service
Level Agreement report.

For this quickstart to function correctly, activity events need to be recorded in the activity store.
Therefore initially it is recommended that you deploy the Order Management Application and
Information Processor quickstarts. However any SwitchYard application could be used.

To deploy the quickstart, after the server has been started, run:

	mvn jboss-as:deploy

To undeploy the quickstart, run:

	mvn jboss-as:undeploy
