== Visualising the Runtime Governance Information

This section describes how to use the Runtime Governance User Interface (UI).

=== Accessing the Runtime Governance UI

To access the Runtime Governance UI, after the server has been started, use the url: +<host>/rtgov-ui+

image::images/RTGovUILogin.png[]

Once displayed, it will request an username and password. When successfully logged in, you will be presented with the top level dashboard:

image::images/RTGovUIDashboard.png[]

The dashboard provides access to three types of information related to runtime governance. These will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.

=== Services

The _Services_ page lists the services that have been deployed to a service container (e.g. switchyard) and are being monitored by RTGov.

image::images/RTGovUIServices.png[]

The list shows the service name, optional application in which it is contained, the external interface(s) it implements and finally the bindings through which it can be accessed.

NOTE: For switchyard services, this list will only contain the public (promoted) services, however activity information will be collected for internal component services as well.

When a service name is selected, it will navigate to the details page:

image::images/RTGovUIServiceDetails.png[]

This page shows high level information about the service, and where appropriate, any promoted references it has to other external services.

The _Dependencies_ tab can be used to view dynamic dependency information about the service. This information is based on a short term rolling window, and will therefore only show the relationships associated with recent invocations:

image::images/RTGovUIServiceDependencies.png[]

=== Situations

This section shows the _Situations_ that are reported when RTGov policies detect issues that need to be bought to the attention of users.

image::images/RTGovUISituations.png[]

The left hand panel provides a variety of options for filtering the list of situations.

The list contains the following columns:

* Severity - an icon to indicate how severe the situation is.

* Type - identifies the nature of the situation (e.g. SLA Violation, Exception, etc).

* Status - where the situation is in its lifeycycle (see further down for description of the lifecycle).

* Subject - the subject of the situation, which will generally be a service type and operation, with optional fault name.

* Timestamp - when it occurred.

* Description - further details about the situation.

* Action - show properties for the situation.

At the bottom left is a collapsed region containing controls for performing _bulk actions_.

image::images/RTGovUISituationsBulkActions.png[]

These actions can operate either on the filtered situations (as shown here), or all situations. The actions themselves, from left to right, are _retry_ (i.e. resubmit an associated message to the target service), _export_ and _remove_.

When a new _Situation_ occurs, if the user is already viewing the situations page, then a small notification will be displayed in the top right corner:

image::images/RTGovUISituationsNotificationSmall.png[]

If this notification is expanded, it will list some of the details for the new _Situations_:

image::images/RTGovUISituationsNotificationExpanded.png[]

The user can either select one of the entries to navigate to it's details, or alternatively use the refresh button to update the list.

To view the details associated with a _Situation_ in the list, select its type field, which will navigate to the details page:

image::images/RTGovUISituationDetails.png[]

This page shows the details of the situation, including properties and context data.

The _Call Trace_ tab shows the call stack associated with the business transaction, if appropriate context information has been recorded with the situation.

image::images/RTGovUISituationCallTrace.png[]

Selecting a node in the call trace displays further details in the right hand panel.

The optional _Message_ tab is displayed if the _Situation_ has an associated business message.

image::images/RTGovUISituationMessage.png[]

If the service and operation, associated with the situation, supports resubmission of the messages (i.e. if a SwitchYard service, then it would need to have an SCA binding and the operation would need to be one-way), then the user will be able to edit the message content and press the _Resubmit_ button. This will result in resubmission information being displayed:

image::images/RTGovUISituationMessageResubmitted.png[]

===== Situation Lifecycle

The following diagram shows the lifecycle of a _Situation_. Transitions are controlled by appropriate buttons presented when viewing the situation details.

image::images/SituationLifecycle.png[]


=== Analytics

RTGov uses http://www.elasticsearch.org/[Elasticsearch] to store the activity information, and http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/[Kibana] to provide a dashboard for analysing that information.

==== Dashboard

The "out of the box" dashboard layout presents the following information:

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsDefaultTop.png[]

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsDefaultBottom.png[]

===== Response Times

This graph displays response time information that matches any defined filter. Initially the only filter that is applied is a default time frame showing information over the last 24 hours (see following section on 'Changing the Time Frame and Refresh Cycle').

All response time information will be shown in the same (green) colour. This enables a general indication of performance to be obtained, but to identify specific issues it will be necessary to isolate response times of interest. This can be achieved using "Filtering by query" to only show response times within a particular range.

It is also possible to colour code response time information associated with particular subsets of the information (e.g. for particular service types, or customers, etc). See _Segmenting information by query_ section for more information.

===== List of Services

This table shows the list of services. Each service is listed with the number of invocations (count) and actions that can be used to focus or exclude the particular service from the information being viewed.

NOTE: The service invocation count is based on the information available after all filters have been applied. This means it is possible to identify how many invocations of a particular service have been performed by setting the timeframe (see 'Changing the Time Frame and Refresh Cycle') or filters on other properties (e.g. customer, host, etc). 

===== Faults

This pie chart shows the distribution of faults that occur within the filtered response time information being viewed.

The segment labels mean:

* "Missing field" refers to response time information that had no associated fault
* "Error" is a general segment to identify response times associated with unnamed exceptions
* All other values are domain specific fault types (e.g. itemnotfound in this case).

Selecting a region from the pie chart will further focus the dashboard on response time information associated with that catagory of fault. To cancel the filter, select the "FILTERING" green tab at the top of the page, and either disable or remove the entry matching the fault filter.

===== Distribution over time

This bar charts shows the distribution of the response time information over time, grouped by a specified time interval (initially 1 minute).

When subsets of information are defined, based on _pinned queries_, it is possible to get more interesting results based on colour coded regions. For example, if separate queries are used to represent response times associated with different service types, then the bars will be colour coded to show how much activity occurred on each of the service types.

===== Operations

This pie chart is used to decompose the activities based on the operations that were performed, subject to any other filters that may have been applied.

It is also possible to create an additional filter on the currently viewed information, based on a particular operation, by selecting the operation of interest's segment within the pie chart. To cancel the filter, simply select the "FILTERING" green tab at the top of the page, and either disable or remove the entry matching the operation filter.

===== Documents

This section provides a list of the most recent response time information. The columns provide a small selection of fields from the response time events, with a list of the available fields as checkboxes down the left hand side. This enables the user to select additional fields of interest.

When a row is selected, it will expand to show the complete set of fields from the response time event, with some 'action' icons next to each value. If the user selects the magnifying glass, then the dashboard will be additional focused on response time information associated with that field value, and similarly selecting the _no entry sign_ will exclude information with that field value.

As mentioned previously, cancelling a particular filter can be achieved by selecting the "FILTERING" green tab at the top of the page, and either disable or remove the entry matching the field filter.

==== Changing the Time Frame and Refresh Cycle

The Kibana dashboard provides a mechanism for users to define the timeframe of interest, and the refresh interval.

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsTimeframe.png[]

The drop down menu at the top of the dashboard enables the user to select from a default set of time ranges in the past to the current time. If one of the default time ranges is not suitable, then a custom value can be selected.

Similarly, the refresh cycle can be selected from the values in the _Auto-Refresh_ sub-menu, or alternatively disabled by selecting 'Off'.

However it is also possible to interactively select a region from the response time graph (at the top of the page), to focus the attention of the dashboard on that time period. This creates a time based filter, which can be cancelled by selecting the "FILTERING" green tab at the top of the page, and either disable or remove the entry matching the time filter.

==== Filtering by selection

The Kibana dashboard enables a user to filter the information being viewed by:

* pressing the _magnifying glass_ symbol associated with some information of interest (see action in the image below)

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsFilteringServiceType.png[]

* pressing the _no entry sign_ symbol associated with the information to be excluded (see action in the image above)

* selecting the information of interest from a pie chart (e.g. selecting a fault, as shown in the image below)

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsFilterSTInventory.png[]

As well as being able to focus/exclude information based on the other graphs, the _Documents_ table provides even more fine grained control over what is displayed. In the following image it shows how the +fault+ value of _itemnotfound_ could be used as a filter, instead of selecting it from the pie chart. However, more importantly adhoc fields such as 'customer' or 'productName' could be equally used as the subject of the filter, if that information is recorded with the activity events (and therefore the response time data).

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsDocFilterFault.png[]

As each filter is added, to progressively refine the results being viewed, their details are listed in the "FILTERING" section at the top of the dashboard, as shown in the following image:

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsFiltering.png[]

The first box identifies the initial time range used to display the data, which has been refined by the next box based on interactively selecting a region on the response time graph. The third box applies a filter to only show information related to the _InventoryService_ service type, and finally the fourth box narrows the information further to show the subset of response time information associated with the _itemnotfound_ fault.

Any of the these filter criteria can individually be disabled (using the _tick_ symbol) or cancelled (using the _cross_ symbol).
 

==== Segmenting information by query

Although filtering provides a useful way to narrow in on information of interest to view that data in the available graphs. It is sometimes more interesting to be able to compare different sets of results.

In the default dashboard all response time information is treated in the same way, and therefore not differentiated. If we want to segment the information based on various groupings, then we need to create what are called _pinned queries_. At the top of the dashboard, you will need to expand the blue "QUERY" region to find a data entry area. This can be used to enter adhoc queries to filter the results displayed in the dashboard (see following section).

However for the purpose of comparing different sets of data, we leave the default entry blank and instead create one or more additional query fields, but pressing the _plus_ symbol present in the last entry field.

When an entry field has been created, enter an appropriate query. For example,

* +serviceType: "{urn:switchyard-quickstart-demo-orders:0.1.0}OrderService/InventoryService"+

This query will identify response times associated with the _InventoryService_ service type.

* +properties.customer: "Fred"+

If the customer name has been associated with the reported activity events, then this query will identify the response time information associated with a particular customer.


As shown in the following image, the colour coded segmented queries are reflected in the response time graph:

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsFilterBySTOrPropCustomer.png[]

as well as the _Distribution over time_ chart:

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsDistributionOverTime.png[]

To change the label associated with a query, select the query coloured dot and enter the label in the field, followed by pressing the close button:

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsPinServiceType.png[]

It is also possible to temporarily disable a particular query, or change its colour, using this popup dialog.


==== Adhoc queries

Some times we need to focus the information on a particular property value or range. For example, if wanting to identify the services involved in increased response times, to locate potential performance issues, then enter the query "max:>100" to show all response times that are greater than 100 milliseconds:

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsFilterMax.png[]

Notice that the _List of Services_ table now only includes the list of services that are related to those higher response times. The same applies to the _Operations_ pie chart lower in the page. This can be used to pin point the services and operations that are causing the performance problems - and also by examining the _Documents_ it is possible to identify other useful information, such as which customer was affected (if that information has been recorded with the activity events).


==== Customizing and sharing the Dashboard

It is possible to customise the dashboard, adding/removing rows and widgets within rows, configuring the graphs/charts/tables, etc.

Once a custom dashboard has been defined, then it can be saved using the _disc_ symbol at the top right of the dashboard:

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsSaveDashboard.png[]

When relaunching the RTGov UI, it is the possible to load a custom dashboard using:

image::images/RTGovUIAnalyticsLoadDashboard.png[]

It is also possible to export a custom dasbboard to a file, enabling it to be distributed to other interested users, who can then import it into their user account. Select the _save_ icon, select _Advanced_ and then _Export Schema_.
