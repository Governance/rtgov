== Installation

=== Setup Target Environment

This section will describe how to install Overlord Runtime Governance in different environments.

==== JBoss EAP or Wildfly

* Download the App Server: http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads/[JBoss EAP] distribution (version 6.1 and 6.3 are currently supported) or http://wildfly.org/downloads/[Wildfly] distribution (version 8.1), and unpack it in a suitable location.

* If using rtgov with switchyard, then download http://www.jboss.org/switchyard/downloads[SwitchYard] (version 2.0.0.Final or higher) and install it into the JBoss EAP/Wildfly environment. We recommend using the switchyard installer, which can be unpacked in a temporary location, and run 'ant' in the root folder to be prompted for the location of the JBoss EAP or Wildfly environment.

NOTE: If switchyard is not installed, then you won't be able to use the quickstarts, which are based around providing runtime governance for a switchyard application.

* Download the latest release of RTGov from the http://www.projectoverlord.io[Overlord website], choosing the appropriate distribution for the target container and installation type (e.g. client only or all). Unpack the distribution into a suitable location.

Note: The difference between the installation types is,

[options="header"]
|=======================
| Value | Description
| client | This will result in only the activity collector functionality being installed, using a RESTful client to communicate with a remote Runtime Governance server.
| all | This will result in the full server configuration being installed into the server, including activity collector (for obtaining activities generated within that server), activity server (for receiving activity information whether from a remote client or internal activity collector), event processor network (to analyse the events), active collections (to maintain result information) and a collection of REST services to support remote access to the information. This is the default value.
|=======================

* The final step is to perform the installation of Overlord Runtime Governance. To do the installation, use the following command from the root folder of the installation:

----
./install.sh [ -Dpath=<location> ]
----

The _<location>_ represents the folder where the JBoss EAP or Wildfly environment exists. If the _<location>_ is not explicitly provided on the command line, then the user will be prompted for the information.

To uninstall, simply perform the following command in the root folder of the installation:

----
./uninstall.sh [ -Dpath=<location> ]
----

To start the server, go to the EAP/Wildfly +bin+ folder and run:

----
./standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
----

The final step is to configure KeyCloak with the Governance realm. This is achieved by following these steps:

* Enter the URL http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/master/console/#/create/realm into your browser

* If first time using KeyCloak on the server, then enter the username 'admin' and password 'admin. You will then be prompted to enter a new password (twice) for the admin user.

* When the create realm page is displayed, it will offer the ability to upload a realm definition. Select the button and when a file dialog appears, navigate to the _dist_ folder within the RTGov distribution and select the _governance-realm.json_ file.

You can also import this governance realm by providing the file as an option when starting the server, e.g.

----
./standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml -Dkeycloak.import=<path-to-distribution>/dist/governance-realm.json
----


* Once the realm has been uploaded successfully, you will be able to log in to the RTGov UI (http://localhost:8080/rtgov-ui) using the username 'admin' and password 'admin'


=== Further Configuration

The configuration properties for the Runtime Governance capability are found in the _<root>/standalone/configuration/overlord-rtgov.properties_ file.

Although there will be some properties that are independent of the installation type, some will be specific and therefore are listed in separate sections below.

_Common_

The common properties available across all installation types are:

[options="header"]
|=======================
| Property | Description
| collectionEnabled | This property will determine whether activity information is collected when the server is initially started. This value can be changed at runtime using the ActivityCollector MBean (see the chapter on _Managing the Infrastructure_).
| ActivityServerLogger.activityListQueueSize | This property defines the queue size for pending activity lists, that are awaiting being reported to the Activity Server.
| ActivityServerLogger.durationBetweenFailureReports | To avoid logs being overlorded with failure reports, failures will only be reported once within the defined time interval (in milliseconds).
| ActivityServerLogger.freeActivityListQueueSize | This property defines the queue size to manage free activity lists that can be reused.
| ActivityServerLogger.maxThreads | This property is an integer that represents the maximum number of threads that should be used to report activity events to the server (whether remote or embedded).
| BatchedActivityUnitLogger.maxTimeInterval | The maximum wait interval (in milliseconds) before sending any held activity units to the Activity Server.
| BatchedActivityUnitLogger.maxUnitCount | The maximum number of activity units that should be held before sending as a batch to the Activity Server.
|=======================

_All Type_

[options="header"]
|=======================
| Property | Description
| ActiveCollectionManager.houseKeepingInterval | Time interval (in milliseconds) between house keeping tasks being invoked.
| ActivityStore.class | The class associated with the Activity Store implementation to be used.
| Elasticsearch.server | URL to the Elasticsearch server (HTTP port).
| infinispan.container | The infinispan container to use.
| MVELSeverityAnalyzer.scriptLocation | Optional location of a MVEL script used to determine severity levels for nodes and links within the service overview diagram.
| SituationStore.class | The class associated with the Situation Store implementation to be used.
|=======================

NOTE: Activity and Situation Store implementation specific properties will be discussed in the database section below.

_Client Type_

This installation type is used to configure an execution environment that will be sending its activity information to a remote Runtime Governance server using REST. The relevant properties are:

[options="header"]
|=======================
| Property | Description
| RESTActivityServer.serverURL | This is the URL of the activity server collecting the activity events.
| RESTActivityServer.serverUsername | The username used to access the REST service.
| RESTActivityServer.serverPassword | The password used to access the REST service.
|=======================


==== Database

This section described the configuration of the supported database options.

===== Elasticsearch

NOTE: This is the default "out of the box" configuration.

To use Elasticsearch as the Activity and Situation Store implementation, the following property values need to be defined:

----
ActivityStore.class=org.overlord.rtgov.activity.store.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchActivityStore
SituationStore.class=org.overlord.rtgov.analytics.situation.store.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSituationStore
----

with the additional support properties:

[options="header"]
|=======================
| Property | Description
| Elasticsearch.hosts | Either has value "embedded" (the default), or a list of <host>:<port> values representing nodes in the Elasticsearch cluster, the port representing the TCP transport connection.
| Elasticsearch.schedule | When using batched mode, the interval (in milliseconds) between updates being sent to the Elasticsearch server.
| Elasticsearch.ActivityStore.responseSize | Maximum size for the response (default value 100000).
| Elasticsearch.ActivityStore.timeout | "Best effort" timeout value (milliseconds) (default value 10000ms).
| Elasticsearch.SituationStore.responseSize | Maximum size for the response (default value 100000).
| Elasticsearch.SituationStore.timeout | "Best effort" timeout value (milliseconds) (default value 10000ms).
|=======================


The following information describes the Elasticsearch clustering options that are supported with RTGov. For more information please see http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-node.html

Out of the box, RTGov starts up with an in-VM Elasticsearch node for convenience. Such a setup is not recommended for a production environment for the following reasons:

* Elasticsearch running on the same JVM could result in resource contention, e.g. memory or cpu, which could impact the application performance

* In a clustered or load-balanced environment we would require Elasticsearch to persist the data to the same cluster

 
RTGov does not attempt to wrap or hide the standard Elasticsearch configurations. If you know how to tweak and tune an Elasticsearch node then these configuration changes can be applied to the appropriate location (dependent upon platform): 

[options="header"]
|=======================
| Value | Description
| EAP or Wildfly | The configuration properties for the Runtime Governance capability are found in the _<root>/standalone/configuration/overlord-rtgov.properties_ file.
|=======================

If you want to learn how to configure and tune Elasticsearch then please reference the Elasticsearch documentation at http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html

Some of those configuration properties that may need to be changed include:

* _cluster.name_: Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique names
* _node.name_: Node names are generated dynamically on startup, so you're relieved from configuring them manually. However you can tie a node to a specific name
* _path.data_: Path to directory where to store index data allocated for this node
 

There are 3 ways Elasticsearch cluster communication can be configured within RTGov:

_Local Elasticsearch embedded server_

----
node.local=true
----

This configuration does not communicate outside of the VM, only performing discovery of Elasticsearch nodes started on the same same VM. 

_Client only with no local data_

When you start an Elasticsearch client, the most important decision is whether it should hold data or not. In other words, should indices and shards be allocated to it. Many times we would like to have the clients just be clients, without shards being allocated to them. This is simple to configure by setting either:

----
node.data=false
----

and/or

----
node.client=true
----

With this configuration, the client is cluster aware and can route its data to the responsible shards avoiding a double hop.


_Clustered client with local data_

This is the default "out of the box" configuration for RTGov. This starts a simple Elasticsearch node that can hold data and also join other Elasticsearch nodes in a cluster.

----
node.data=true
node.client=false
node.local=true
----


===== SQL

To use a SQL database as the Activity and Situation Store implementation, the following property values need to be defined:

[options="header"]
|=======================
| Property | Value
| ActivityStore.class | +org.overlord.rtgov.activity.store.jpa.JPAActivityStore+
| SituationStore.class | +org.overlord.rtgov.analytics.situation.store.jpa.JPASituationStore+
|=======================

with the additional support properties:

[options="header"]
|=======================
| Property | Description
| JPAActivityStore.jndi.datasource | The JNDI name used to retrieve the datasource.
| JPAEventProcessor.jndi.datasource | The JNDI name used to retrieve the datasource.
| JPASituationStore.jndi.datasource | The JNDI name used to retrieve the datasource.
| JpaStore.jtaPlatform | The JTA platform Java implementation class.
|=======================


WARNING: As of RTGov 2.x, Elasticsearch is the main supported implementation of the Activity and Situation Store.


=== Test the installation using the samples

When RTGov has been installed, try out the samples to get an understanding of its capabilities, and check that your environment has been correctly installed/configured.

==== JBoss EAP

To install the samples into JBoss EAP go to the +samples+ folder in the distribution. You will need to install http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Maven] to be able to use the examples.

The key examples are explained below. Each quickstart also has a readme providing the instructions for use.

===== Order Management

The +samples/ordermgmt+ folder contains examples related to an Order Management system implemented using a SwitchYard application.

The +samples/ordermgmt/app+ folder contains the switchyard application, with some additional interceptors to execute policies synchronously (see Activity Validators section for more information, and the Synchronous Policy quickstart more a specific example of its use).

The +samples/ordermgmt/epn+ folder contains an Event Processor Network (see later section for details) that is used to convert switchyard application exceptions into "Situations", which is a form of alert used by the Runtime Governance platform.

The +samples/ordermgmt/ip+ folder contains an Information Processor (see later sectoin for details) that is used to extract additional information from message payloads, that will be useful when analysing the activity events.

===== Policy

The +samples/policy/sync+ folder contains a policy that is invoked synchronously - it determines whether a user has invoked the service more than once every two seconds, and if so, blocks the service invocation.

The +samples/policy/async+ folder contains a policy for asynchronously calculating the debt associated with a customer, and suspending their account if it goes above a defined level. The suspended status of the customer is checked when they next invoke the service, and the service invocation blocked if they have been suspended.

===== SLA

The +samples/sla/epn+ folder contains a policy for determining whether a Service Level Agreement has been violated, and if so, reported as a _Situation_.

The +samples/sla/monitor+ folder contains a webapp that directly integrates with the RTGov components.


=== JBoss EAP Specific Information

==== SQL Database

The database is defined by the datasource configuration located here: +$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployment/overlord-rtgov/rtgov-ds.xml+ as part of the 'server' installation type.

The default SQL database is the H2 file based database, and is created during the installation of the 'all' type.

NOTE: The following sections discuss changes to the +standalone-full.xml+ configuration file. If using a clustered
environment, then these changes should be applied to the +standalone-full-ha.xml+ instead.


*MySQL*

* Create the folder +$JBossAS/modules/mysql/main+.
* Put the MySQL driver jar in the +$JBossAS/modules/mysql/main+ folder, e.g. mysql-connector-java-5.1.12.jar.

		<security>
			<user-name>....</user-name>
			<password>....</password>
		</security>
	</datasource>
</datasources>
----



==== Caching

The EPN and Active Collection mechanisms both have the ability to make use of caching provided by infinispan. When running the server in clustered mode (i.e. with +standalone-full-ha.xml+).

First step is to uncomment the 'infinispan.container' property in the +overlord-rtgov.properties+ file and set it to the JNDI name of the cache container ('java:jboss/infinispan/container/rtgov' in the example below). This property represents the default cache container to be used by EPN and Active Collection Source configurations that do not explicitly provide a container JNDI name.

The next step is to create the cache container configuration, and the specific caches, under the 'infinispan' subsystem in the +standalone-full-ha.xml+ file. As an example, the following cache entry for the "Principals" cache has been defined, for use with the Policy Enforcement examples:

----
            <cache-container name="rtgov" jndi-name="java:jboss/infinispan/container/rtgov" start="EAGER">
                <transport lock-timeout="60000"/>
                <replicated-cache name="Principals" mode="SYNC">
                    <locking isolation="REPEATABLE_READ"/>
                    <transaction mode="FULL_XA" locking="PESSIMISTIC"/>
                </replicated-cache>
            </cache-container>
----
